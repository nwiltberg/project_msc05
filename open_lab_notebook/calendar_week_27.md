# Calendar week 26 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- add more comments to jupyter notebook 'data exploration'
- add plottings for one subject in 'data exploration'
- create project presentation

## Completed tasks
- added plottings for one subject in 'data exploration'
- created first draft of project presentation
- started a new notebook about data analysis
- computed a correlation matrix for one participant (with Peers help!)

## Problems
- adapt the code to gain correlation matrix (Peer fixed that)

## Goals $ tasks for next week
- create a loop that computes a correlation matrix for all participant
- think about this:
    - what do the `connectivity matrices` reflect? 
    -  how would the `connectivity matrices` be utilized within the `analyzes`?
        - can they be used "as-is"?
        - if not, what should be changed?
