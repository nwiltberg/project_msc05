# Calendar week 44 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- add more comments in jupyter notebooks
- create a loop that computes a correlation matrix for all participants
- think about this:
    - what do the `connectivity matrices` reflect? 
    -  how would the `connectivity matrices` be utilized within the `analyzes`?
        - can they be used "as-is"?
        - if not, what should be changed?

## Completed tasks
- wrote loop that computes correlation matrix for all participants (1 hour)
- lecture about deep learning (1,5 hours)
- added more comments in jupyter notebook 'Data Analysis' (1 hour)
- meeting about next steps and aim to get more participants (1,5 hours)

## Problems
- too few participants?
