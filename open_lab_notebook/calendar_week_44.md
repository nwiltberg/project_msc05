# Calendar week 44 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- add more comments in jupyter notebooks
- create a loop that computes a correlation matrix for all participants
- think about this:
    - what do the `connectivity matrices` reflect? 
    -  how would the `connectivity matrices` be utilized within the `analyzes`?
        - can they be used "as-is"?
        - if not, what should be changed?
