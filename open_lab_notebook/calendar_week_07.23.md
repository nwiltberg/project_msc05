# Calendar week 7/2023 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- download connectivity matrices from brainlife (again got an answer on brainlife slack channel and Peer restarted the CPAP pipeline)
- update Zotero library and zitations in jupyter notebooks
- edit README about the data
- edit README about the code



## Completed tasks
- weekly meeting (30 min.)
- updated Zotero library and zitations in jupyter notebooks (1.5 hours)

## Problems
- tried to download connectivity matrices for 2 hours but again I ran into error "url malformed" 
    tried this for multiple subjects and also for different ids to build up the url
    discussed this in weekly meeting -> since the colleagues from brainlife don't know what to do either, the procurement of a larger data set unfortunately failed



## Goals & tasks for next week
- edit READMEs
- write the derivation of the research question
- evaluate the results and write a discussion
