# Calendar week 42 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- add more comments in jupyter notebooks
- create a loop that computes a correlation matrix for all participants
- go through lecture about model evaluation and cross-validation
- think about this:
    - what do the `connectivity matrices` reflect? 
    -  how would the `connectivity matrices` be utilized within the `analyzes`?
        - can they be used "as-is"?
        - if not, what should be changed?

## Completed tasks
- added comments in the jupyter notebook 'data exploration' (1 hour)
- meeting to clarify the next steps (30 min.)
- went through lectures about AI, unsupervised vs. supervised learning, model evaluation and cross-validation (1 hour)
