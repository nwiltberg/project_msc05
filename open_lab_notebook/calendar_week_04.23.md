# Calendar week 4/2023 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- explore results of the clustering
- download connectivity matrices from brainlife (finally got an answer on brainlife slack channel about the question how I get the object ids for each subject of a project to loop over them)



## Completed tasks
- weekly group meeting (30 min.)
- loaded object ids (30 min.)
    first had some issues using the bash command in the jupyter notebook
- tried to figure out how to build up the loop to load the data (1,5 hour)

## Problems
- unclear how I can create a loop that simultaneously loops over the object and subject ids (both of them are needed to build up the path to the wanted output file)

## Goals & tasks for next week
-
