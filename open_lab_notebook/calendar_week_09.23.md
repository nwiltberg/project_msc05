- worked on chapter about data and project management (1,5 hours)


## Problems
- The Github page I created only contains the README file of my repository but not the files I added as chapters in the Table of Content
    -> solved: template to create jupyter book was not ready yet
- the chapter "Discussion" of the jupyter book and the website do not contain the links to the papers cited, although these are included in the jupyter notebook
    -> solved: this was due to an uncorrect link
- the interactive plot of the Data Analysis is not shown in the jupyter book / website
