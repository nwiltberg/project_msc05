# Calendar week 47 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- explain why plotting of the connectome is only left hemisphere
- find out how to get confound files
- check: [Nilearn: Classification of age groups using functional connectivity](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html#classification-of-age-groups-using-functional-connectivity) 
        think about: why use correlation as connectivity measure?


## Completed tasks
- checked: [Nilearn: Classification of age groups using functional connectivity](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html#classification-of-age-groups-using-functional-connectivity) and read [Dadi et al (2019)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811919301594) (1 hour)
- lecture about Deep Learning (1,5 hours)
- weekly meeting -> use brainlife to get motion parameters for NYU sample (1 hour)
- learned more about gradient descent (30 min.)

## Problems
-  

## Goals & tasks for next week
- explain why plotting of the connectome is only left hemisphere
- start with implementing a supervised learning algorithm
- download motion parameters for NYU sample from brainlife
