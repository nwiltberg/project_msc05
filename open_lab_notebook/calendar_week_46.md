# Calendar week 46 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- adapt the used #-comments in the jupyter notebooks
- explain why plotting of the connectome is only left hemisphere
- find a way to load a larger data set
- check: https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html#classification-of-age-groups-using-functional-connectivity 
        think about: why use correlation as connectivity measure?


## Completed tasks
- adapted the comments in the notebook data_exploration (30 min.)
- tested how to load data from the website NITRC using code (30 min.)

## Problems
- couldn't find a way to add the labels to the plotting of the connectome
