# Calendar week 46 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- adapt the used #-comments in the jupyter notebooks
- explain why plotting of the connectome is only left hemisphere
- find a way to load a larger data set
- check: https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html#classification-of-age-groups-using-functional-connectivity 
        think about: why use correlation as connectivity measure?
- transform correlation matrix into vector
- match the subject id's of the phenotypic file
- sign up on neurostars.org and ask how I can get the confound files of the ADHD-200 sample


## Completed tasks
- adapted the comments in the notebooks data_exploration and data_analysis (2 hour)
- tested how to load data from the website NITRC using code (30 min.)
- meeting to check out how to get the dataset (1 hour)
- asked question about dataset on neurostars.org 
- matched the subject id's of the phenotypic dataframe with the subject id's of the func and confound files (1 hour)
- adapted correlation matrices (plot only lower triangle)
- converted correlation matrices into vectors

## Problems
- couldn't find a way to add the labels to the plotting of the connectome
- unclear how to get more data
