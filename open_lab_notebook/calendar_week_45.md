# Calendar week 45 - goals & tasks

## Goals & tasks
- adapt correlation matrix so that the diagonal = 0
- use diverging color map for correlation matrices
- explain why plotting of the connectome is only left hemisphere
- add labels to plot 
- explore dataset found in the meeting (chance for more participants)
- check: https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_group_level_connectivity.html#classification-of-age-groups-using-functional-connectivity 
        think about: why use correlation as connectivity measure?


## Completed tasks
- adapted correlation matrices (diagonal = 0 and diverging colormap) (1 hour)
- tried to figure out how to load preprocessed open dataset ADHD-200 (1 hour)

## Problems
- couldn't find a way to add the labels to the plotting of the connectome

## Goals & tasks for next week
