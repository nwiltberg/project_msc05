Hello everyone and welcome to the page of a research project created as part of a module of the neuro-major at Goethe-University Frankfurt.

The aim of this project is to investigate functional connectivity in patients with ADHD using resting state fmri data.

The page contains the following chapters:

* [Literature Review](https://nwiltberg.github.io/project_msc05/code/Literature_Review.html)

   The derivation of the research question and an overview of current studies

* [Data- and Projectmanagement](https://nwiltberg.github.io/project_msc05/code/Data_and_Projectmanagement.html)

   Description and evaluation of the dataset and information regarding verion control, GitHub, Zotero, the Open Lab Notebook and the Computational Environment

* [Data Exploration](https://nwiltberg.github.io/project_msc05/code/Data_Exploration.html#)

   Exploration of the dataset used in this project

* [Data Analysis](https://nwiltberg.github.io/project_msc05/code/Data_Analysis.html)

   Computation of the functional connectomes and setup of a supervised and an unsupervised learning algorithm

* [Discussion](https://nwiltberg.github.io/project_msc05/code/Discussion.html)

   Evaluation and discussion of the results of the Data Analysis
