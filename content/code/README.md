# Code description

In this folder, you will find the code used to analyze the data structured in jupyter notebooks.

If you want to know more about the conception of the research question and the literature it is based on, you will find corresponding information in the juypter notebook 'Literature_Review'.

More information about the dataset used in this project and concerning the project management can be found in the notebook 'Data_and_Projectmanagement'.

The jupyter notebook 'Data_Exploration' describes how the data was downloaded and how it is structured. It also includes the first steps to prepare the data for analysis.

The jupyter notebook 'Data_Analysis contains all the steps that were taken to analyze the data. So the calculation of the functional connectivity, the classification using a supervised learning algorithm and the clustering using an unsupervised learning algorithm.  

Furthermore, you can find the computing environment in this folder which was used to run the code.
